# Program: 2048
## By: Zach Zager
### Primary build time: May 2015
#### Purpose: to simulate the hit game 2048 as a fun
			  in-terminal game

Files:

	main.cpp 			Gives instructions.
						Runs the game.
						Runs the game or ends if the user loses.
						Prints the board.

	tile.h 				Tile class header file

	tile.cpp 			Contains all of the functions making up the
						tile class. Allows for the manipulation of the
						value of tiles.

	gameBoard.h 		gameBoard class header file.
						Contains variables to store the board size.
						Contains a 2D array that represents the board.

	gameBoard.cpp 		Contains all of the gameBoard class functions.



Notes:
	This game is far from complete. It could implement improved feedback
	to the user as well as an out-of-terminal interface.
